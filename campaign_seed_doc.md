📌 SYSTEM OVERVIEW: Draugr’s Hearth (Koronus Expanse)

A resource-rich but spiritually cursed star system. Dominated by fire-worshipping hive-worlders, radioactive asteroid belts, Ork ruins, and sleeping Necron machines beneath the ice. Encircled by a stellar hazard known as The Blazing Choir, which sings harmonics heard only by psykers and broken machine spirits.
