That table is populated by a **separate** ingest workflow (`python -m daggr_workflows.single_app ingest` or campaign_kb API).\n- If the campaign_kb DB is empty, `retrieve_context` falls back to DocumentIndex or full text scan.\n- To use KB search effectively, run campaign_kb ingest first. Use the **Campaign docs** node in the Daggr ingest workflow, or `POST /ingest/campaign-docs`. This ingests from `campaign_docs_root` (default: `campaign_kb/campaign`), which aligns with RAG's `campaign_docs`.\n\n## Indexing and Retrieval\n- Current retrieval: full-text search in `campaign_kb` (Sections table) when `use_kb_search` is true and DB is populated; otherwise DocumentIndex or full text scan.\n- Optional vector layer: ChromaDB semantic retrieval; enable with `use_chroma: true`.\n- Retrieval targets:\n  - Sections for queries\n  - Canon anchors for generation prompts\n\n## ChromaDB semantic retrieval (Option B)\n\nOptional semantic retrieval via ChromaDB + sentence-transformers. Enable with `use_chroma: true` in `ingest_config.json` under `rag_pipeline`.\n\n**When to enable Chroma:**\n- **Enable** when you want semantic search (meaning-based retrieval) over campaign docs and PDFs. Better for conceptual queries (e.g. \"faith and corruption\") and when keyword matches miss relevant content.\n- **Leave disabled** (default) when keyword/theme retrieval is sufficient, or when you prefer minimal dependencies (no PyTorch/sentence-transformers). First run with Chroma enabled downloads the embedding model (~90MB for all-MiniLM-L6-v2).\n\n**Install:**\n```bash\ncd ObsidianVault/scripts\npip install -r requirements-rag.txt\n```\nNote: sentence-transformers pulls PyTorch (~2GB). Use CPU-only if disk is constrained.\n\n**Config** (in `ingest_config.json` → `rag_pipeline`):\n- `use_chroma`: `true` to enable, `false` for legacy keyword retrieval (default).\n- `chroma.persist_dir`: Path for ChromaDB persistence (default: `Campaigns/_rag_cache/chroma`).\n- `chroma.embedding_model`: Model name (default: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).\n- `chroma.collection_name`: Collection name (default: `arc_forge_rag`).\n\n**First-run:** Index is built automatically when the pipeline runs with `use_chroma: true` and the collection is empty. Campaign docs and PDF text are chunked, embedded, and stored with chunk tags as metadata.\n\n**Incremental updates:** Set `chroma.incremental: true` to add or update docs without full rebuild. When enabled and the collection already has data, the pipeline removes existing chunks for each doc in the current text_map and adds new chunks. This requires `doc_key` metadata on chunks (already present). Full rebuild remains the default (`chroma.incremental: false`) for simplicity and to avoid partial-state issues.\n\n**Fallback:** If ChromaDB or sentence-transformers are not installed, the pipeline falls back to legacy keyword/DocumentIndex retrieval.\n\n**Canon modes:** Strict, Loose, and Inspired By are preserved; metadata filters apply to ChromaDB queries.\n\n**Hybrid retrieval:** Set `retrieval.strategy: \"hybrid\"` to combine ChromaDB semantic search with DocumentIndex keyword retrieval using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Requires both `use_chroma: true` and a built DocumentIndex. Results from both retrievers are merged by source, scored with RRF (k=60), and deduplicated.\n\n## Pattern Analysis Workflow\n- Inputs: campaign docs + extracted PDFs.\n- Outputs: entity counts, co-occurrence hints, theme tallies.\n- Canon bias: prefer seed + campaign sources when scoring patterns.\n\n## Storyboard Configuration\n\nStoryboard generation uses config-driven campaign context and constraints. In `rag_pipeline` config, set `storyboard.campaign_context` (list of strings) and `storyboard.constraints` (list of strings) to customize the storyboard prompt. Defaults match Rogue Trader / Carcharodon Astra content. Override in `ingest_config.json` under `rag_pipeline.storyboard`.\n\n## Content Generation Workflow\n- Inputs: context summary + top entities + user prompt.\n- Outputs: rules, adventure arcs, bios, rumors.\n- Guardrails:\n  - Must cite canonical sources when possible.\n  - Flag speculative details explicitly.\n\n## Prompt Templates (base)\n**Rules Draft Prompt**\n```\nUse only the provided context. Draft a concise rules module with:\n- Scope\n- Mechanics\n- Example of play\nContext:\n{context}\n```\n\n**Adventure Seed Prompt**\n```\nGenerate a 3-act adventure outline grounded in the context.\nInclude: hook, key scenes, adversaries, and fallout.\nContext:\n{context}\n```\n\n**Bio Pack Prompt**\n```\nGenerate 3 NPC bios tied to the factions/locations provided.\nEach bio: role, motivation, secret, hook.\nContext:\n{context}\n```\n\n## RAG Metadata Schema (doc-level)\n- RAG_Link: `campaign/05_rag_integration.md`\n- RAG_Entity_Types: NPC, Faction, Location, Item, Theme\n- RAG_Pattern_Targets: fields that should be mined for patterns\n- RAG_Generation_Targets: outputs that should be generated from this doc\n- RAG_Source_Priority: ordered list of canonical sources\n\n## Chunk metadata schema (chunk-level)\n\nPer-chunk tags for targeted retrieval. Keys match the schema below; values are strings (or empty).\n\n| Field | Description | Allowed values / examples |\n|-------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **System** | Game system or source book | `W&G`, `D&D`, `generic` |\n| **Faction** | Faction or faction-adjacent | e.g. `Inquisition`, `Smugglers`, (empty) |\n| **Location** | Place or region | e.g. `Footfall`, `void`, (empty) |\n| **Time_period** | Era or time frame | e.g. `current`, `historical`, (empty) |\n| **Mechanical_vs_narrative** | Content type | `mechanical`, `narrative`, or empty |\n| **Tone** | Tone tag for matching | `grimdark`, `heroic`, `absurd`, `neutral`, or empty |\n\nIngestion (B2) stores these per chunk in the document index. Omitted keys are treated as unrestricted for filtering.\n\n## Retrieval modes\n\nDM-facing modes for how strictly to match chunk tags. Selectable when calling the retrieval API (e.g. `run_pipeline(..., retrieval_mode=\"Loose Canon\")`).\n\n| Mode | Meaning | Filtering /",

Anything it SYSTEM\ntouches starts to fizz and disintegrate, including the deck-plating below, releasing a plume of highly toxic\ngas which burns the lungs of anyone who inhales it. 6 Survivors?: Hammering can be heard from inside a sealed compartment, along with voices begging for\nrelease, promising a share of the untold riches inside. But nothing Human could have survived on a hulk\nlike this for so long, could they? The only way to tell is to open the door... 7 Undying Grudges: The explorers are caught in the middle of a bitter resource war between the\ndescendents of the ship’s crew and the grandchildren of the Astra Militarum regiment they were\ntransporting when the vessel was lost. Brokering peace seems impossible — but it might be the only way\nto escape... 8 Infected: The air in this section of the hulk is thick with spores which lie in clotted lumps on the floor\nand dribble loathsomely down the walls. Soon the explorers are coated in a thick layer of green goop —\nand the Nurgle cult responsible aren’t far away. 9 Open the Seals: A malfunctioning cogitator incorrectly decides that an uncontrolled blaze is spreading\nthrough the hulk. Airlocks creak as one after another they open to the void, and everything aboard must\nbe secured or risk being propelled out into space. 10 Inverted and Unhealthy: This section of the hulk’s dying gravity generators fluctuate wildly. For the\nnext hour gravity varies at random between nothing at all and three times Terran standard, before they\nfail completely. 11 The Hornet’s Nest: Breaching a former cargo hold disturbs a hibernating hive of psychneuein (see\npage 16).

As the stasis field flickers and fails, his ghastly\ntransformation into a massive beast of Chaos begins.

EXTERNAL EVENTS\n2d6 Event\n2 Dissolution: With an ear-rending shriek of metal, part of the hulk’s superstructure tears free, opening\na huge hole to the void and destabilising the whole structure. Anyone aboard will have to act quickly to\nescape before the hulk disintegrates completely. 3 Collision Course: Solar winds, residual momentum and a brief burst from one of the decaying engines\nsets the vessel on a trajectory towards the nearest solar system. If its course can’t be corrected the\ndevastation will be appalling. 4 Exploratory Surgery: An Adeptus Mechanicus ship docks on the hulk and unleashes a small army of\nservitors bent on carving the vessel into manageable chunks, while their parent vessel begins towing a\nprize portion of the hulk away for study. 5 His Holy Inquisition: The massive bulk of an Inquisitorial Strike Cruiser approaches the hulk and makes\nimmediate contact through the Agents’ secure channel. A short time later a squad of Battle Sisters appear\nand escort them to the Inquisitor herself, who issues orders the team are in no position to refuse. 6 Heavy Fire: Without warning, a Battle-Barge of Astartes appears and opens fire on the hulk with its\nmacro-cannons. It’s hard to say what’s more terrifying — the threat of being obliterated entirely, or\nwhatever’s on board the hulk that merits this firepower... 7 Prior Claim: A vessel belonging to the Rogue Trader Gerda Vandermeer, of the Varonius Flotilla, arrives,\nand demands that the team surrender all items of value retrieved from the hulk, citing her prior claim. Lady Captain Vandermeer’s soldiers board the hulk, seize the explorers’ own vessel, and hold it hostage\nfor the ‘return’ of ‘her’ salvage. 8 Impending Impact: Approaching at an unsafe speed, an Ork Rok is heading straight for the hulk,\nclearly intent on embedding itself in the hull. The impact may well be enough to kill anything in the\ncompartment at the time, and the Orks will clear up whatever’s left... 9 Strange Meeting: Several small Aeldari craft appear and surround the hulk, but make no immediate\nattempt to come aboard. If the Agents find the artefact the xenos are looking for and attempt to take it off\nthe hulk, the Aeldari’s peaceful demeanour could change rapidly. 10 Spacewalk: The vessel’s observatorium was said to contain untold treasures but it lies down a corridor\nthat is now crushed and impassable. The only way to reach it is via a perilous spacewalk across the\nrazor-sharp, twisted metal of the hull — and if something was to go wrong, help would be far away. 11 Memories of Forgotten War: The ship’s macrocannon battery roars into life as the decayed cogitators\nof the ship’s machine spirit perceive a phantom enemy and open fire on any vessel nearby — probably\nwhatever transport the explorers used to get there. 12 External Infestation: The inside of the hulk seems clear of xenos — but that’s not so true of the hull. A\ngroup of Genestealers have been lying dormant outside the vessel, and now they’ve noticed movement\nindoors they’ll stop at nothing to get inside and obey their biological imperatives. 14\nHIGH-TIER EVENTS\nThe grim darkness of the 41st Millennium is a terrifying place.

Those who explore a certain section of the hulk find it a\nshifting maze of crushing bulkheads, sparking cables and fluctuating gravity. AGENTS OF\nGILEAD\n4 Teeming With Life: It’s not unusual to find Genestealers on space hulks, but this one is infested to a\ntruly phenomenal degree.

SYSTEM\n7 Ship of Fools: The ship’s entire crew has been irrecoverably corrupted by the Ruinous Powers, rendered\ninto a screaming gestalt of rotting flesh and shattered bone that fills the entire hulk like a hermit crab in\nits shell. 8 Titanicus: The vast bulk of an Imperial Titan fills a hold on the hulk, its crew long dead. The Titan's\nreactor is still functioning - barely - and something is causing it to overheat. If it blows, it could tear the\nhulk apart, surely destroying any living organisms onboard. 9 The Wild Hunt: The hulk is the site of a ritual hunt led by an Archon of the Drukhari. Swift, clever and\nruthless, their first action is to close off all avenues of escape, before unleashing an army of Ur-ghuls,\nSuccubi, Incubi and Homonculi in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. 10 The Heart of the House: The walls of this hulk drip with mucus, and the deeper any explorers go\nwithin, the warmer and more humid the atmosphere becomes, until the walls themselves seem to be\nbreathing. The hulk is alive, animated by a daemonic spirit… and waking up. 11 Khrave Slavers: The foul xenos known as the Khrave infest this ship — massive, hulking warriors bent\non enslaving anyone they meet, each one as large as a Primaris Astartes and wielding warp-glamoured\nweapons capable of carving through ceramite like a monoknife through butter.

MISSION BRIEFS\nThe Lost Volume\nThe nobility of Enoch, immured within their vast plascrete bastions, maintain an outward show of\ndevotion matched only by the depths of their private depravity. One popular manifestation of piety is\nthe collection and public display of religious tomes. It is not uncommon for planetary nobles to send\nmembers of their entourage to acquire particularly rare, sacred, or valuable works. Recently, rumours have emerged that a woman by the name of Vilmaria Torris is offering a truly\nenormous reward to anyone capable of delivering a previously all-but-unknown volume, the Liber\nServitium, reputed to have been in the Compostela’s scriptorium at the time it was lost. While the name\nof the patron on whose behalf she is acting remains unknown, the sum offered means the buyer must\nbe outstandingly wealthy. One further stipulation is in place: the retrieval of the book must be carried\nout with the utmost discretion. In particular, the Ecclesiarchy must know nothing of the mission. Vilmaria is secretly a loyal agent of the Inquisition, though her superiors’ motives in this regard are\nunknown to her. Family Ties\nElodie St Sebastian is the younger daughter of a house of minor nobility. Her elder brother Aurelius, the\ncurrent holder of the family title, was lost on the Compostela while on the pilgrimage required of him\nby family tradition. However, without evidence of his death, sufficient time has not yet elapsed for the\nlocal Administratum to allow Elodie to succeed in her brother’s place — the family’s stature, wealth and\ninfluence has suffered bitterly as a result. Elodie is keen to employ skilled and resourceful agents to bring definite proof of her brother’s death. Once her claim is recognised she’ll have a fortune with which to show her gratitude. Until then, she’ll do\neverything she can to hide the dangerous level of debt she’s already in. And if her agents were to find\nher brother alive: she’d be willing to add a little more to make sure that he doesn’t return. 26\nSPACE HULK\nCORRUPTED SCRIBES GENERATOR\nTier 1 2 3 4\nSPACE HULK\nEVENTS\nThreat T T T T\nKEYWORDS: CHAOS, TZEENTCH SPACE HULK\nLOOT\nS T A I WIl InT Fel\n1 1 1 2 1 3 2 SPACE HULKS\nOF THE\nResilience FORESAKEN\nSYSTEM\n4 (Tattered Robes: AR 0)\nAGENTS OF\nDefence Wounds Shock\nGILEAD\n1 3 2\nSTRANGE\nSKILLS: Default 2, Awareness 3 (Passive 2) SERVITORS OF\nTHE FORSAKEN\nBONUSES SYSTEM\nMindless: This Threat automatically passes Resolve\nTests.

Before he vanished, he left a message asking his former friend to meet him\non his former mining vessel, the Dominus Vobiscum. It sounds like he’s willing to talk, and he might\nhave an explanation for what he did, if the Agents are willing to come to him. If they do manage to find Grizari and talk peacefully to him on the ship, he’ll attempt to convince them\nthat he only carried out the theft to draw attention to the plight of his people trapped on the hulk.

From astronomers watching Gilead’s sun flare and\nflux, to a doomsday sect of the Adeptus Mechanicus,\nto an unfortunate but effective new source of servitor\nbiomass, these cults bring grim life to Avachrus’s\nskies, depths and wastelands, and drag Agents out of\nthe relative safety of forges and manufactoriums into\nencounters with xenos and heretics. CULTS OF NETHREUS\nNext come cults from the Knight World of Nethreus. Some are insular sects of nobles guarding a dangerous\nsecret about who really holds power on. Others are\ncommoners who have turned from the righteous\nworship of the Emperor and his Divine Machines to the\nhedonistic consumption of a harmless but confounding\nfungus.

Creeping Threat: This vehicle was used in the decisive ambush that obliterated a mutant colony\n6\nfrom the wastes of Avachrus. Forged in the Fires of the Warp: The voidship on which this vehicle was travelling was assaulted\n7\nand boarded by Aeldari Corsairs, leading to its use in an unconventional voidside battle.

A Catechism of Cogs: This vehicle is rarely removed from its garage or hangar — it’s used to teach\n10\nnovice Tech-Priests the anatomy, function, and rituals of maintenance for this class of vehicle.

Siege Breaker: This vehicle was part of the reinforcements that lifted the siege of Port Vauntar, when\n12\nthe moon Anval was invaded by the forces of Chaos. 10\nMARKS OF HONOUR\n2d6 Marks of Honour\nTHE CULT\nAncient Code: A unique scriptural fragment, said to be a copy of the Omnissiah’s own work, occupies MECHANICUS\n2\na key part of this vehicle’s machine code. Ornate Decoration: The interlocking cogs adorning this vehicle’s surface are not merely functional, VENERABLE\n3 but also astonishingly beautiful. MACHINES\nMark of the Archmaster: This vehicle’s maintenance logs indicate it was once repaired by Tech-\n4\nPriest Samar Veer before his ascension to Archmagos. ON THE NATURE\nOF MACHINE\nThe Gratitude of the Astra Militarum: The vehicle carries the regimental banner of a Lord Militant’s SPIRITS\n5\npersonal regiment, in grateful thanks for heroic assistance. Memento Mori: The mechanical parts of the vehicle’s dead crew lie in state within, though the weak FAITH &\n6\nflesh has long since been disposed of. FUNCTION\nThe Cog and Skull: The massive insignia mounted atop this vehicle marks it out from its fellows as\n7\na vehicle of great age and reputation. TRAVEL\nBlood-Red Banners: This vehicle bears the massive standard of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and it is\n8\naccorded the place of honour in every battle line. VEHICLE RULES\nWhat Does Not Destroy Us Makes Us Stronger: Massive rents in the body of this vehicle have been\n9\nrepaired with glittering adamantium veins. THE WORKSHOP\nBreak Not the Ritual: The litanies of the Adeptus Mechanicus are etched into the bodywork of this\n10\nvehicle, a perpetual reminder of the faithful’s obligations. The Foe Subjugated: The preserved remains of former enemies adorn this vehicle in a fearsome VEHICLES\n11\ndisplay of prowess. The Hand of Unity: Somewhat unusually, this vehicle bears a relic of an Imperial Saint, carried as a APPENDIX\n12\ngesture of comradeship between the two cults. QUIRKS AND CUSTOMISATIONS\n2d6 Quirks and Customisations\n2 Unique STC: This vehicle is built to a nonstandard design, its STC believed to be lost. The March of Days: Time has taken its toll on this ancient vehicle. Despite a constant battle between\n3\nmaintenance and decay, its days are clearly numbered. Burning Heart: An incredibly powerful reactor powers this vehicle, making the temperature inside\n4 the vehicle uncomfortably high. If the reactor’s shielding were damaged, the radiation leak would\nbe fatal. Sins of the Flesh: A pair of Servitors inhabit this vehicle, following simple instructions from the crew\n5\nand filling the atmosphere with a faint but pervasive scent of decay. Binary Chatter: Speakers built into the vehicle’s hull emit a continual stream of binary in praise of\n6\nthe Omnissiah. Eternal Service: A heavily modified Tech-Priest is built into the driver’s compartment of this vehicle,\n7 their few remaining fleshy parts sustained by canisters of liquid nutrients and occasional infusions\nof saline. User Manual: The vehicle contains records of the rituals used to maintain it — though of course, no\n8\none but the Adeptus Mechanicus is permitted to carry them out. Ritual Controls: The vehicle must be given commands in a certain, very specific order, or it refuses\n9\nto respond. 10 Blithe Spirit: The Machine Spirit of this vehicle is swift, adaptable, and remarkably easy to drive. 11 Thoughts of War: The vehicle has additional cogitators to aid in aiming its weapons systems. 12 Forbidden Secrets: Somewhere in this vehicle’s heart lurks a useful and deeply heretekal device. 11\nADEPTUS\nMINISTORUM\nMACHINES\nPart mobile cathedrals, part engines of war, nothing\nexemplifies the martial might of the Ecclesiarchy so\nmuch as the battle engines of the Adepta Sororitas. The Sisters of Battle have in their possession a diverse\narray of tanks appropriate to most battlefield roles. With everything from anti-personnel weapons to those\ndesigned to destroy fortifications or other vehicles,\nthe Adepta Sororitas are well-equipped for their\nholy mission. High-ranking Ecclesiarchs occasionally requisition\nvehicles for ceremonial or personal purposes, though\nthe Sororitas take a dim view of any who use their holy\nvehicles for frivolous ends. PAST ENGAGEMENTS\n2d6 Past EngagEmEnts\nCrusader: This vehicle was used by a midranking member of Saint Julyanna Gilead’s command staff\n2\nduring the Gilead Crusade. Diplomatic Service: This vehicle was part of the Battle Sisters’ show of force that prevented open\n3\nwarfare between the noble houses of Syrne and Alingwe on Gilead Primus. The Flame of Chivalry: This vehicle accompanied Imperial Knights in the extermination of a heretic\n4\ncolony in the active volcanoes of Nethreus.",

    "preview": "the noble houses of Syrne and Alingwe on Gilead Primus. The Flame of Chivalry: This vehicle accompanied Imperial Knights in the extermination of a heretic\n4\ncolony in the active volcanoes of Nethreus. Holy Shield: This vehicle was previously used by the Order of the Sanctified Shield in their stalwart\n5\ndefence of Enoch. There are no longer enough Battle Sisters in the Order to crew it. Blood of the Martyr: Saint Kizenga died preventing this machine from falling into the hands of her\n6\nenemies, a heroic act now depicted in stained glass in one of the cathedrals of Gilead Primus. Ever Penitent: This vehicle valiantly supported the defence of the Cathedral of St Gelitta against\n7\nflagellant heretics. Missionary Work: This vehicle once patrolled the wastelands of Gilead Prime, preaching the tenets\n8\nof the true faith to the warlike scum who make their homes there. 9 Privilege & Beneficence: This vehicle was once commandeered by the radical Inquisitor Gorebrandt. Unblemished: This vehicle has been in constant use since the Gilead Crusade but has seemingly\n10\nnever had a single part replaced. Death in the Sanctuary: This vehicle was recovered after an appalling slaughter on the Shrine\n11\nWorld of Enoch, but the fate of its last crew is unknown. Betrayed: This vehicle was almost destroyed by friendly fire from the Adeptus Astartes in the\n12\nnotoriously confusing Battle of Elath’s Rift. 12\nMARKS OF HONOUR\n2d6 Marks of Honour\nTHE CULT\nHoly Touch: It is said this vehicle once felt the touch of Saint Celestine herself, and still bears her MECHANICUS\n2\nhandprint seared in holy fire. A Silver Thorn, A Bloody Rose: Gifted in thanks by the Canoness of the Order of the Bloody Rose, VENERABLE\n3 MACHINES\nthis vehicle is adorned with a thicket of briar and roses, wrought of enamelled adamantium. The Face of Wrath: Ornate bas-relief carvings covering the panels of this vehicle depict the holy\n4 martyred saints of the order in battle with daemonic enemies. ON THE NATURE\nOF MACHINE\nLaudate Dominum: As soon as this vehicle moves, a vast set of Laud Hailers spring into life, SPIRITS\n5\nbellowing hymns of adoration to the God-Emperor. The Light That Guides: A stained-glass window with blackened adamantine channels adorns the\n6 FAITH &\ntop of this vehicle, backlit to project vivid pools of colour before it wherever it goes. FUNCTION\nThe Fires of Faith: A splendid array of braziers adorn this vehicle. The fires never require fuel, a\n7\nsymbol of the Emperor’s light. TRAVEL\nOur Martyred Lady: Draped in the vestments of her order, the skeletal remains of a martyred hero\n8\nlie in state within this vehicle as a perpetual reminder of a Sister’s duty. VEHICLE RULES\n9 Labyrinthine: None of this vehicle’s controls are quite where they should be. The Martyr’s Tears: The painted face of Saint Alicia Dominica upon this vehicle perpetually weeps\n10 THE WORKSHOP\nsacred machine Oil. The Ashen Cross: This vehicle is surmounted by an ancient banner bearing the heraldry of the Black\n11 Templars, though how it was acquired is lost to history. VEHICLES\nA Sacred Blade: An exquisite reliquary built into this vehicle’s chassis holds a Power Sword of\n12\nancient manufacture, bound in place with purity seals and to be used only in times of desperate need. APPENDIX\nQUIRKS AND CUSTOMISATIONS\n2d6 Quirks and Customisations\nIn Death, Victory: A huge quantity of promethium explosive has been built into this vehicle; it\n2\nignites if the vehicle is ever destroyed. Dual Service: This vehicle has served more than one order of the Adepta Sororitas, and it is claimed\n3\nby both as their rightful property. Sole Survivor: Decorated in the colours and bearing the insignia of a lost order of Sororitas; not even\n4\nthe name of this vehicle’s original order is known. The Guns of Wrath: Weapons have been fitted to every available point on this vehicle, requiring\n5\nonly skilled hands to use them. Portable Prayers: This vehicle contains a small portable shrine, which issues regular and insistent\n6\nreminders at appointed prayer times. 7 Burn the Heretic!: This vehicle has been fitted with a Heavy Flamer adorned in crimson and gold. Incensed to Fury: This vehicle continually produces a fog of sacred incense that trails in its wake\n8\nand fills its interior. In War, Terror: This vehicle is fitted with a set of viciously curved forward spikes set at precisely the\n9\ncorrect height to impale any enemy foolish enough to stand before it. Mortification of the Flesh: The vehicle’s controls are connected to a modified neural lash, causing\n10 an intense pain to any who takes hold of them — a perpetual reminder of the God-Emperor’s\neternal sacrifice. Cherubim and Seraphim: A small flying Servitor attends this vehicle, usually managing to be in\n11\nexactly the wrong place at the wrong time. 12 Never Back Down: This vehicle cannot be reversed; all the better to advance into battle. 13\nASTRA\nMILITARUM\nMACHINES\nThe vehicles of the Astra Militarum are forged with a\nsingle purpose in mind: the art of war. Although their\ndesign and construction remains the province of the\nAdeptus Mechanicus, most vehicles have a designated\nEnginseer capable of carrying out basic litanies of\nrepair and maintenance. Astra Militarum vehicles run the gamut from troop\ntransports to heavy tanks, each one emblazoned\nwith regimental colours and company details. They’re\nusually just as richly equipped with myths and legends\nabout miraculous survival and victories snatched\nfrom the jaws of defeat. No matter their regiment or\nhomeworld, the troops of the Astra Militarum put a\ngreat deal of faith in their vehicles. PAST ENGAGEMENTS\n2d6 Past EngagEmEnts\nHome Guard: This vehicle formed part of the Gilead Gravediggers’ fierce defence of their barracks-\n2\nmoon against an Orkish incursion. Fortunate Survivor: This vehicle drove unscathed across a two-kilometre minefield to reinforce the\n3\ndefenders of Port Vauntar. Psyker Slayer: This vehicle was instrumental in quelling an uprising amongst the imprisoned\n4\nPsykers of Ironforge. Aeldari Slayer: This vehicle was deployed in the short and highly successful campaign to turn back\n5\na flotilla of Aeldari attempting to migrate from inhospitable Trollius. Drukhari Slayer: This vehicle fought a desperate action against Drukhari raiders in the Kharnuk\n6\nMountains on Ostia. Pax Imperialis: This vehicle stood vigil outside Hive Mallorant, on Nethreus, keeping the peace\n7\nduring the infamous Seven-Year Famine. Prodigal: This vehicle briefly fell into the hands of mutant warbands on Vulkaris but was bravely\n8\nrecaptured. It still bears disturbing modifications made to adapt it to the mutants’ forms. Necron Slayer: The Machine Spirit of this steely vehicle has a particular loathing for the Necrons,\n9\nafter a past defeat whose details are encrypted and classified. Thieftaker: This vehicle played a pivotal role in purging a Genestealer Cult from a promethium\n10\nrefinery on Charybdion. Warp Survivor: This vehicle was once briefly exposed to the Warp. Its rear panelling appears\n11\nunnaturally smooth, with a mirror-like sheen, no matter how often the panel is repainted or replaced. Exterminator: Once deployed as part of a crusade to extinguish a now-forgotten xenos species, this\n12\nvehicle still bears the unusual battle scars left by a foe that has faded from existence. 14\nMARKS OF HONOUR\n2d6 Marks of Honour\nTHE CULT\nIncorruptible: The chassis of this resolute vehicle is charred black, pitted with the marks of ancient, MECHANICUS\n2\nsearing flames from a battle against an unimaginable foe. Ancient Purity Seals: Ancient purity seals awarded in conflicts long past are preserved in battle- VENERABLE\n3 damaged display cases on the vehicle’s exterior. MACHINES\nBlessed by the Ecclesiarchy: This vehicle bears exquisite liturgical texts both outside and within,\n4\nthe gift of the Ecclesiarchy.

ON THE NATURE\nOF MACHINE\nAnointed by the Omnissiah: For unknown reasons, this vehicle has attracted the interest of the Cult\nSPIRITS\n5 Mechanicus. At least once every Terran year, a hooded group of Tech-Priests appear and requisition\nthe vehicle, returning it smelling strongly of incense and greasy with machine oil. FAITH &\nComparative Comfort: This vehicle has been customised to give the crew slightly more room to\n6 FUNCTION\nmove around. Names of the Dead: This vehicle is a veteran of hundreds of bloody conflicts. The sacrifice of its\nTRAVEL\n7 many crews is acknowledged on a stone tablet listing their names and the conflicts in which they\ngave their lives. Shatterer of Will: Sharpened spikes have been fitted to the nose and axles of this vehicle in VEHICLE RULES\n8\nrecognition of its fearsome prowess. Banner of Bravery: A majestic banner flies over this vehicle, proudly displaying its battle honours THE WORKSHOP\n9\nand regimental colours. The Chalice and the Rose: This vehicle once fought alongside the Sisters of Battle, defending a holy\nVEHICLES\n10 site on a far-flung colony world. It still bears the insignia of a Sororitas order, as well as a gilded\nfleur-de-lis. APPENDIX\nAstartes Ally: Centuries ago, this vehicle fought alongside the mighty Adeptus Astartes, honoured\n11\nfor their service with the gift of a laurel wreath. Guided by the Emperor: Legend holds that this vehicle escaped certain death through the God-\n12 Emperor’s direct intercession. Lengthy orisons and hymns telling the tale of its own personal miracle\nboom continually through the vehicle’s Laud Hailers. QUIRKS AND CUSTOMISATIONS\n2d6 Quirks and Customisations\n2 Deadly Trophies: The embalmed heads of this vehicle’s foes are proudly displayed on the chassis. Regimental Transfer: This vehicle began its career in a different regiment. Some consider this a\n3\nbond between the two services; for others, it may induce a profound sense of rivalry. Redacted History: For reasons unknown, the history of this ancient vehicle has been expunged\n4\nfrom the public record, though its cogitator records may yet hold secrets to its past. Recovered from Ruin: This vehicle was captured by the enemy and only returned to service after\n5\nextensive ritual cleansing. Even now, some traces of its misadventures remain. 6 Unruly Soul: This vehicle is possessed of a truculent and uncooperative spirit. Unidentified Upgrade: It would appear the Adeptus Mechanicus have gifted this vehicle with\n7\nadditional functionality, without providing any instructions on how to use it. Notched beyond Numbers: A kill tally has been scratched on the side of this vehicle so many times\n8\nthat the absolute number can no longer be discerned. Liquid Ration Dispenser: Unusual for a vehicle of this pattern, it has been fitted with a liquid ration\n9\ndispenser capable of sustaining its crew as long as it is fed with raw organic substrate. Eternal Service: The former crew of this vehicle died in glorious service to the Imperium. The\n10\nmartyrs’ bones are integrated into the machine itself, a permanent reminder of their brave sacrifice. Mischievous Machine: Although usually co-operative, the Machine Spirit of this vehicle is possessed\n11\nof a wicked and somewhat obstructive sense of humour. Bloodthirsty Spirit: Murderous and swift, the spirit of this vehicle makes it a point of honour to 15\n12\nensure it is at the vanguard of any assault. ADEPTUS\nASTARTES\nMACHINES\nThe unfaltering Adeptus Astartes dominate any\nbattlefield, the more so when accompanied by their\nmassive machines of war. Unlike the other factions,\nwho employ the Adeptus Mechanicus directly, the\nTechmarines of the Adeptus Astartes take care of\ntheir vehicles with well-trained piety, having trained\nalongside devout and knowledgeable Tech-Priests. When they’re badly damaged or retired, the majority of\nAdeptus Astartes vehicles in the Gilead System return\neither to the Absolvers’ stronghold of Castle Grigori,\non Gilead Primus, or aboard the battle barge The Vow\nof Absolution or Fury’s Blade. PAST ENGAGEMENTS\n2d6 Past EngagEmEnts\n2 Memories of Heresy: This venerable vehicle’s first battle was against Slaaneshi heretics. Last Stand: This vehicle’s last crew lost their lives suppressing a foul Genestealer Cult that took root\n3\non Brassyl. The Battle for the Reach: When Ork invaders dropped from the space hulk Persephone’s Regret\n4\nonto Ostia’s moon, this vehicle was there to hold them off. Our Brother’s Keeper: When an Imperial noble fell to the whispering corruption of Chaos, this\n5\nvehicle was part of the campaign that purged him and his traitorous company. 6 Wych Hunter: This vehicle engaged Wych and Hellion slavetakers in the Reach. 7 Ground Zero: This vehicle survived days of aerial bombardment by WAAAGH! Nekkstompah. Undaunted: This vehicle bears the scars from an encounter with the Death Guard in the farthest\n8\nfringes of the Gilead System. 9 Toe to Wing: This vehicle briefly battled alone against the Daemon Vyzzek’t Graal, Changer of Ways. Master of the Voidmire: This vehicle fought Khorne-worshipping pirates on an asteroid fortress in\n10\nthe Voidmire. Betrayed: This vehicle was almost destroyed by friendly fire from the Adepta Sororitas in the\n11\nnotoriously confusing Battle of Elath’s Rift. House Guard: This vehicle participated in the cleansing of the wastelands around the Absolvers’\n12\nsecret garrison of Castle Grigori. 16\nMARKS OF HONOUR\n2d6 Marks of Honour\nTHE CULT\n2 Scroll of Honour: This vehicle bears a personal commendation from the leader of their Chapter. MECHANICUS\n3 Great Pelt: The fur of a monstrous, savage beast adorns this vehicle.

ON THE NATURE\nOF MACHINE\n6 Iron Halo: The crew of this vehicle have been honoured for their tactical acumen. SPIRITS\nAquila Imperialis: The Imperial Aquila on this vehicle tells a tale of participation in a battle officially\n7\nacknowledged as a Righteous Victory.

TRAVEL\nThe Gift of Life An exquisite blood-red gem is set into the bodywork of this vehicle — the gift of a\n10\ngrateful member of the Blood Angels. VEHICLE RULES\nOssific Relics: The vehicle contains a number of small scrimshawed bones — the honoured remains\n11\nof lost battle-brothers. Trophy Rack: This vehicle contains a number of trophies taken from slain enemies across many THE WORKSHOP\n12\nworlds, in the Gilead System and beyond. VEHICLES\nAPPENDIX\nQUIRKS AND CUSTOMISATIONS\n2d6 Quirks and Customisations\nCopper Blight: This vehicle has a small but stubborn patch of corroded metal that spreads with every\n2\nattempt to excise it but otherwise never grows in size. Scars: New panels have been welded on to cover battle damage. The vehicle’s paint job tries, and\n3\nfails, to cover its scars. Indomitable Machine Spirit: The Machine Spirit of his vehicle is bellicose and aggressive. It seems\n4\nto handle slightly better, and move slightly faster, when charging directly towards the enemy. 5 Silent Running: This vehicle is quieter than most of its type. Mobile Command Platform: This vehicle is equipped with Vox Casters, cogitator banks, and a\n6\nnumber of remotely operated Servo-Skulls. The God-Emperor’s Wrath: An external Vox Caster chants battle hymns of the Chapter as the\n7\nvehicle rolls into battle. War Stories: One of the cogitators on the vehicle contains audio records describing previous\n8\nengagements, left by the former crew. Field Repairs: The Machine Spirit of this vehicle is prone to breaking down at inopportune moments. 9\nThe vehicle is therefore kitted out with an extensive set of maintenance gear.",

Turbo-Powered: This vehicle’s engines are larger, and louder, than those of most of its kind, though\n10\nthey are no more powerful. Advanced Auspex: Complex sensors gather a wide array of readings from the surrounding area. 11\nMost are unintelligible to all but the most senior Tech-Priests of the Machine Cult. 12 Aspiration Incarnate: Once piloted by Aspirants, this vehicle has simplified controls. 17\nINDEPENDENT\nIMPERIAL\nMACHINES\nThe expense of owning and maintaining a vehicle\nrenders possessing one impossible for many citizens. Extremely wealthy individuals, such as Planetary\nGovernors and Rogue Traders, are the only private\nindividuals likely to own personal transports. Such\nvehicles are often well maintained, elaborately\ndecorated, and extensively customised by their owners. Their owners may loan them to valued inferiors when\nit’s appropriate to a given mission or as a reward for\nloyalty. Needless to say, allowing such a valuable gift\nto return damaged, even cosmetically, is an enormous\nslight against these powerful people, many of whom\nhave fragile egos. FORMER MASTERS\n2d6 Former masters\nInhuman Construction: Though tremendous effort has been made to hide the fact, this vehicle was\n2\nnot originally of Imperial manufacture. Truly Ancient: The exact age of this vehicle is unknown, but it appears to bear a manufacturer’s\n3\nstamp from Holy Terra itself. Inquisitorial Past: At some point in its past, this vehicle served the Emperor’s Holy Inquisition. Who\n4\nknows what secrets it might have witnessed? Rogue Traders: This vehicle is decorated with the dynastic emblem of the Rogue Trader house Yun. 5\nHow they came to part with it is a mystery. Church Property: At some point in its past, this vehicle was the personal transport of a prominent\n6\nEcclesiarch, and it still has numerous religious fittings. Enforced Retirement: This rather bland vehicle once belonged to a local planet’s enforcers. It retains\n7\na selection of paramilitary hardware and quite a reputation among the local criminals. Mechanical Genius: This vehicle has been extensively modified by the Adeptus Mechanicus for a\n8\nspecific purpose, though it’s not clear what that purpose is. Portable Library: The Adeptus Administratum once owned this vehicle, and it retains numerous\n9\nbookshelves and cupboards for the use of its current owner. Privately Owned: Formerly the property of a planetary dignitary, this splendid vehicle allows its\n10\nowner to travel in the utmost luxury. Spoils of War: Previously the property of the Astra Militarum, this vehicle has been extensively\n11\nrefurbished for civilian use. Stolen Goods: At some time in the past, this vehicle was acquired by less-than-legitimate means —\n12\nand someone wants it back. 18\nMARKS OF HONOUR\n2d6 Marks of Honour\nTHE CULT\n2 Inquisitorial Accolade: The Machine Spirit of this vehicle has been honoured by the Inquisition.

Ecclesiarchy Debt: A local Eccelsiarch owes a favour to the owner of this vehicle for services\n11 previously rendered.

Luxuriously Appointed: Much larger than a usual member of its class, this vehicle contains a\n3\nluxury sleeping area. Cry for Help: When someone attempts to breach the exterior of this vehicle, multiple alarms scream\n4\nuntil the correct passphrase (currently a line of scripture) is uttered to shut them off. Entertainment Centre: An on-board cogitator contains recordings of every performance by the\n5\nGovernor’s Operatic Ensemble of Gilead Prime from the last 10 years. Gun Locker: This vehicle has been fitted with a weapons locker for emergencies, though it is\n6\ncurrently empty. 7 Flashy Paint Job: This vehicle’s decoration is at the cutting edge of fashion. 8 Soundproof: Sound doesn’t carry into this vehicle.

Chauffeur Driven: For reasons long since lost in the mists of time, this vehicle comes with its own\n11\nservitor driver. Self-Sustaining: This vehicle runs on no known fuel. Whatever powers it is esoteric and probably\n12\nextremely dangerous, heretical, or both. 19\nASURYANI\nVEHICLES\nInhuman in form, function, and design, the Aeldari\ncommand a truly dizzying array of vehicles. Though\ntheir empire is much diminished, the sight of their\nflyers filling the air like a flock of magnificent predatory\nbirds recalls their former glory. When Craftworld Ul-Khari collided with the planet\nTrollius and was partially buried in the ice, the impact\ndestroyed huge areas of the planet-sized ship and\nwreaked devastating harm on the structures and\nobjects inside it, including many of the Craftworld’s\nvehicles. The precious wraithbone used in their frames\nis in short supply, so repairs are currently unthinkable. As the Craftworld recovers, the Gilead System will no\ndoubt see more elegant Asuryani craft take to the skies. PAST ENGAGEMENTS\n2d6 Past EngagEmEnts\nExpeditious Emissary: This vehicle once carried the injured Farseer Venorath Eldrann from the\n2\nbattlefield after a devastating defeat by the Absolvers. The Enemy Has Three Faces: This vehicle has faced no fewer than three different Space Marine\n3\nchapters in its legendary history: the Absolvers, the Raven Guard, and Salamanders. Prince of Frost: This vehicle attended Craftworld Ul-Khari’s first contact with the Imperium after its\n4\nlanding on Trollius. 5 Kinslayer: This vehicle fought Drukhari amongst the asteroids and broken worlds of the Voidmire. 6 A Symphony in Wraithbone: This vehicle features by name in more than a dozen epic poems. A Gift Untreasured: This vehicle accompanied the Varonius Flotilla for some time, then returned\n7\nbadly damaged. Indomitable Spirit: This vehicle was constructed from the parts of a dozen storied Aeldari craft, each\n8\nthe only survivor of a skirmish. 9 Bird of Paradise: This vehicle narrowly escaped destruction in a scouting mission on Ostia. Exodite Craft: This vehicle belonged to an Exodite trading party aboard Craftworld Ul-Khari when\n10\nit collided with Trollius. A Lost Song: Legend has it this vehicle fought, and was defeated by, Necrons, but the coordinates\n11\nof the battle have been expunged from all records.

    "preview": "Mighty Roar: The weapon makes a fearsome sound when fired. When making a ranged attack, the wielder\n2\ncan also make an Intimidation Interaction Attack on the target as a Free Action. Blessed Efficiency: Whether through arcane science or faith in the God-Emperor, this weapon consumes far\n3 less ammunition that it should. When reloading this weapon, roll 1d6; on a result of 5-6, no ammunition is\nconsumed. Piercing Hatred: This weapon excels at killing specific enemies of the Imperium; roll on the Enemy Keyword\n4 Table (page 18) to determine which. Against enemies with that Keyword, the weapon ignores the target’s\nbase Resilience when reducing Damage (Armour applies as normal). Divine Guidance: The weapon’s shots are seemingly directed by the hand of the God-Emperor Himself. The\nuser may shift an Icon to eliminate either a single category of penalty on the Test, or bonus to the target. Roll\n5\n1d6 to randomise between: 1-2. Eliminate Range Penalties, 3-4. Eliminate Vision Penalties, 5-6. Eliminate\nSize Penalties\nRighteous Fury: The weapon seems to delight in causing particularly horrific wounds. Every Critical Hit with\n6 this weapon is improved as if 1 point of Glory had been spent. The wielder may still spend Glory points on\nadditional effects, if available. 16\nAMMUNITION RELIC POWERS\n1D6 Power\n1 Saint’s Tears: This ammunition was anointed with the tears of a saint who vowed to avenge the many fallen THE EXALTED\n& THE PROFANE\nsoldiers of a battle. On a successful ranged attack, each enemy hit grants the user +1 Resilience until their\nnext turn. EXEMPLARS\nLux Deum: The shell casings, prometheum canisters or charge packs bear the seal of a famously militant hero OF FAITH\n2\nor saint. They burn with a supernatural light when fired, inflicting the Blinded Condition on a successful hit. SERVANTS\nSanguis Sancti: Anointed with the blood of a saint who died in battle, this ammunition demands its targets OF THE\nshare the same fate. A successful hit inflicts the Bleeding Condition, even if the target is normally immune OMNISSIAH\n3\nto Bleeding; daemons bleed the very energy holding them together, while Necrons leak coolant, lubricants or\nwhatever other xenos filth flows through their blasphemous necrodermis. TALENTS\nBlessed with Hatred: This ammunition was blessed with prayers against a specific enemy of the Imperium. 4\nRoll on the Enemy Keyword Table (page 18). The weapon deals double damage to enemies with this Keyword. PATHS TO\nGLORY\nHeretek Denunciation: This ammunition reserves special hatred for the technology of the enemy, and\nrebukes their Machine Spirits. The target of an attack made with this ammunition cannot use a Power Field HALLOWED\nto roll Determination against Mortal Wounds caused by the attack. GROUND\n5\nAdditionally, targets hit with this ammo roll an automatic Complication on their next action, if that action\nuses any technology. Even unpowered melee weapons miss, fumble, or break. If the target has the HERETIC\nKeyword, attacks with this ammunition also have +Rank AP. Fury’s Ally: Emblazoned with potent religious wards and litanies of disgust, this ammunition feeds off\n6 the hatred of its user. A weapon using this ammunition gains the Force Trait; the attacker adds half their\nWillpower Rating to the Damage total. The user does not need to have the PSYKER Keyword to benefit. ARMOUR, CLOTHING, AND POWER FIELD RELIC POWERS\n1D6 Power\n1 Bulwark of the Soul: The Relic protects the soul as much as the body. While wearing this Relic, the DN of\nall Tests against Fear, Terror, or Intimidation are reduced by 1. Blessed Healing: The Relic slowly but surely knits flesh and bone back together in battle. At the end of each\n2 combat round, the wearer heals 1 Wound. Outside of combat, this relic will only activate to restore 1 Wound\nwhen its wearer is Dying. They still fall Prone and take a Memorable or Traumatic Injury. Blessing of [Skill]: The holy power of this Relic courses through the body, imparting knowledge or\nsharpening reflexes. The Gamemaster chooses a Skill; while worn, this Relic grants +2 bonus dice to that\n3\nSkill. If you are using the optional rule Innate vs Learned (Wrath & Glory Rulebook, page 127), this allows\na character to make a Test for Skills they would otherwise have at Rating 0. Countersmite: This Relic answers those who dare to strike its wearer with a mighty blow of its own, be it\narcs of electricity, flames, or a gust of rending spectral blades. Choose a Condition (Wrath & Glory Rulebook,\n4\npage 197). When an enemy successfully hits the wearer in close combat, they must pass a DN 3 Initiative\n(I) Test or take 1 level of that Condition. Abhor the Witch: This Relic is especially contemptuous of the warp, fortifying the wearer against it. When\n5\nthe wearer is targeted by a Psychic Power, the caster must increase the power’s DN by 2. Haste of the Righteous: The Relic grants alarming quickness of thought and action in battle. During combat,\n6\nenemies cannot take Free or Reflexive Actions against the wearer. 17\nAUGMETIC RELIC POWERS ENEMY\nKEYWORD\n1D6 Power\nTABLE\n1 Multitask Benediction: The sacred augmetic performs the function of two\naugmetics; an Augmetic Arm might also filter toxins from the bloodstream like\n4D6 Keyword\nan Augmetic Respirator, or include a Cardioproxy or Mechadendrite. 4 Vehicle\nSupreme Craftsmanship: This exquisite augmetic was crafted by high-ranking\nTech-Priests, or hails from the Dark Age of Technology, and is heavily blessed 5 Beast\n2\nby the Machine God. Any numeric bonuses from the Augmetic are doubled. If\nit’s a Ballistic Mechadendrite weapon it gains the Mastercrafted Upgrade. 6 Mutant\nVoice in the Machine: The augmetic whispers knowledge of the Omnissiah’s 7 Psyker\nblessings in your mind, granting you an unusual affinity for technology. 3 Owners gain the Binary Chatter Trait (Wrath & Glory Rulebook, page 130), 8 Necron\neven if they lack the ADEPTUS MECHANICUS Keyword. If they already\npossess Binary Chatter, the +Double Rank bonus becomes +Triple Rank. 9 Tyranid\nNull-alloy: The augmetic is constructed from barely understood archaeotech 10 Daemon\nmaterials with warp-resistant properties. Augmetic eyes can see through warp\n4\nillusions, augmetic limbs or weapons inflict +2ED on psykers and daemons,\n11 Heretic\nand other augmetics grant +2 Defence against daemons and Psychic Powers. 12 Khorne\nMotive Force Discharge Capacitor: The augmetic slowly builds and stores an\nelectrical charge from the owner’s own bioelectric field. Once per game session,\n5 13 Nurgle\nthe owner may discharge this capacitor at a target up to 10m away. This is\ntreated as Moderate Electricity Damage (Wrath & Glory Rulebook, page 201). 14 Chaos\nLogic of Hatred: The augmetic is charged with animosity toward a specific\n15 Tzeentch\nenemy of the God-Emperor or Omnissiah. Roll on the Enemy Keyword Table. 6 The augmetic hums or vibrates when enemies with that Keyword are within 20m\n(this may initially require a DN 3 Insight (Fel) Test for the Agent to recognise). 16 Slaanesh\nIn combat, the user gains +1 bonus dice on Attacks against that enemy. 17 Aeldari\n18 Ork\nTOOL, EQUIPMENT AND TRINKET RELIC POWERS\n19 Genestealer\n1D6 Power\n20 Drukhari\n1 Blessing of Opportunity: The wearer may make 1 extra Reflexive Action\nper round. 21 T’au\nRighteous Wrath: On a Wrath Critical, the owner may make another attack as 22 Kroot\n2\na Free Action. 23 Abhuman\nShield of Purity: The Relic repels the corruption of the Ruinous Powers.
