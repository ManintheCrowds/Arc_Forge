# Narrative Workbench

Short lines. Bullet-dense. Minimal adjectives. See [narrative_workbench_spec](docs/narrative_workbench_spec.md).

---

## [CAMPAIGN STATE]

- Current arc:
- Tone sliders (grim ↔ absurd, lethal ↔ narrative):
- Last Archivist run: `Campaigns/_session_memory/YYYY-MM-DD_archivist.md`

---

## [ACTIVE THREADS]

- Unresolved: see #hook/open or threads note
- Consequences (from Foreshadowing): [[Campaigns/_session_memory/threads]]

---

## [SESSION INPUT]

- Session Summary (for Archivist): use [Session_Summary_Template](docs/Session_Summary_Template.md) or block in session_note
- Major events / NPCs / unresolved threads / player surprises / tone shift / intent signals

---

## [AI PROPOSALS]

- Story Architect: 3 session frameworks (when Frame step runs)
- Encounter Designer: draft encounters (Stage 2 output)
- Archivist: canonical timeline / consequences / retrieval anchors (Phase 4)

---

## [DM DECISIONS]

- Chosen framework / complications / moral beats
- Feedback per encounter: `Campaigns/{arc_id}/{arc_id}_feedback.yaml`
- Edits to task_decomposition or storyboard before Stage 2
