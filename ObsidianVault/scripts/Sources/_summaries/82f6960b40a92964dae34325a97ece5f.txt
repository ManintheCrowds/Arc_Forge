As a Reiver of the Absolutors Chapter in Wrath & Glory, you are an elite warrior trained in psychological warfare and sabotage. Your abilities include infiltration, stealth, and coordinated terror attacks, allowing you to operate behind enemy lines and dismantle entire armies without firing a shot in return. With your Mark X Phobos Power Armour and other advanced technology, you are a formidable force on the battlefield. Additionally, as a Primaris Reiver, you have access to unique abilities such as Psychic Mastery, Librarius Discipline, and Chapter Cult. Your wargear includes Mk VII Astartes Power Armour, Psychic Hood, Bolt Pistol, Force Stave, 3 Frag Grenades, and 3 Krak Grenades. Your influence is +2, indicating that you are a highly valued member of your Chapter. As a Reiver, you are committed to mastering psychological warfare and unleashing your full Primaris strength in carefully coordinated terror attacks. While you may struggle for acceptance amongst your Firstborn Astartes Battle-Brothers, the Reivers of the Absolutors seem least troubled by this ostracisation. You care less for the Chapter rites on the Vow of Absolution than for terrorising the Imperium's enemies, and the Gilead System offers plenty of opportunities to satisfy your obsession.
