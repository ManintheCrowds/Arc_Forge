# Starter Kit README

## Purpose
This starter kit gives you a consistent campaign structure and a workflow that pairs with the KB ingest/search/merge endpoints.

## Where Everything Lives
- Campaign templates: `campaign/`
- Research notes: `campaign/notes/`
- KB workflow: `docs/KB_WORKFLOW.md`

## Update Loop (After Each Session)
1) Update `campaign/06_session_log.md`
2) Add new NPCs, factions, locations, and missions as needed
3) Add new open questions and research targets

## Notes on Citations
When you pull mechanics or lore from the KB, add a short citation in each file under “Citations / KB Links.”
