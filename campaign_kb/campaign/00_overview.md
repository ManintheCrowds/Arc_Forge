# Campaign Overview
**Title:** Ashes and Ice: Frozen Wrath  
**Tone:** Gothic desperation, grimdark horror, kinetic survival  
**Tier:** 2  
**Core Themes:** Cold vs heat, decay vs obsession, faith vs entropy, motion as survival  
**Player Buy-In:** Rogue Trader crew and allied misfits navigating a cursed, resource-rich system  
**Primary Conflict:** A cryo-plague and psychic cold vectors tied to cult activity and ancient xenos remnants  
**Campaign Hook (1–2 sentences):** The Harbinger of Woe enters the Draugr’s Hearth system to stabilize a failing promethium supply chain, only to uncover a Nurgle-aligned cold cult and a psyker contagion riding the mag-train arteries of Hive Varnax.
