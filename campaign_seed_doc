CAMPAIGN SEED DATA: FROZEN WRATH – WRATH & GLORY TIER 2
1. Setting: Hive Varnax (Varnax Prime)

World Type: Industrial Prometheum-extracting hive world

Environment: Arctic ice age with geothermal vent fields, caustic storms

Hive Structure: Towering spires above ground, vent-core tunnels below

Transit: Mag-train lines across frozen plains and through molten tunnels

Atmosphere: Dying imperial world choking on frost, decay, and entropy

2. Themes and Symbolic Axes

Chaos = Cold: Stasis, entropy, ice as death and stillness

Holiness = Heat: Fire as life, motion, and divine spark

Decay vs Obsession: Empire rots, PCs pursue personal goals (e.g., fungal life, suffering, science)

Kinetic Theater: Movement = survival (trains, snowmobiles, collapsing ice)

Grimdark Comedy: Orks, hereteks, and rogue traders behave monstrously, often hilariously

3. Factions and Enemies

Cult of Cold Benediction (Nurgle-aligned):

Belief: Entropy preserves purity. Heat is rot.

Plague: Frost zombies, psychic cold vectors, cryo-crystal mutations

Leader: Magos Varn-Etherox, a dark mechanicum slug-hybrid summoner

Speed Freek Ork Warband – “Da Skidderz”:

Style: Mad Max + Snowmobiles

Leader: Klawjam Skitz, stealthy Blood Axe obsessed with “red stealth armor”

Role: Chaotic third party that ambushes, loots, or bargains

Patron: Inheritor Aelric Vyron

Rogue Trader’s progenitor, uses holographic vox-ghosts to direct party

Motive: Study, not stop, the plague. Morally ambiguous techno-theurge

4. Core Characters

Rogue Trader: Obsessed with Orkoid biology, seeks to catalog and weaponize fungus

Ork Freebooter: Strongest of his clan, cunning and kinetic. Might become a cult figure.
